Q1.
Do your empirical results support the proposition? Explain why or why not:

For easier reading here is one of the resulting outputs of running my code:
N		MaxComp		MaxExch
16		26			13
32		56			27
64		117			52
128		240			104
256		487			204
512		972			402


My experimental results do indeed support the proposition:
We may see that every entry in MaxComp column is less than twice the value of N
We can also see that every entry in MaxExch is less than the value of N

Therefore both statements of the proposition i.e. the maximum number of comparisons is less than 2N and the maximum number of exchanges is less than N 
have been satisfied.
